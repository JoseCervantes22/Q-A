There could be other disagreements over medical issues in your claim. A Qualified Medical Examiner (QME) can be asked to address those disagreements.  A QME may be asked to determine:
• Whether or not your injury was caused by your work
• Whether or not you may need future treatment for your injury
• Whether or not you need to stay home from work to recover
• The level of permanent disability that may have resulted from your work-related injury

Workers Comp ,What is the first day of disability for IDL for the purpose of calculating the 52 weeks or appropriate work hours in the two year period for IDL?,"The first day of disability is the first day of lost time, not the date of injury. Since the day of injury is paid as Administrative Time Off, it would not be appropriate to include the date of injury as the beginning of the IDL period. It is important to remember that all days of disability must be confirmed by State Fund and may be partial days of disability.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp , Is time used on the date of injury picked up as Administrative Time Off only after the workers’ compensation claim is approved?,"No. If the employee missed time from work on the date of injury, this time is Administrative Time Off even if the claim is not approved for workers’ compensation benefits.

Workers Comp ,Is IDL paid for time lost from work to attend medical appointments related to the employee’s workers’ compensation injury?,"No, not after July 1, 2014. IDL is paid for medically substantiated periods of disability that State Fund has confirmed. The obligation to pay IDL ends when the injured employee returns to work, is deemed able to return to work, or when the employee’s medical condition achieves permanent and stationary status. If the employee is able to work, time off solely to attend a medical appointment does not constitute a period of disability.

Workers Comp ,"How is the three calendar day waiting period calculated after July 1, 2014?","IDL is not paid for the first three days after an employee leaves work as a result of the injury unless temporary disability continues for more than 14 days, the injury is the result of a criminal act of violence, or the employee is hospitalized for treatment required by the injury. The three day waiting period shall be identified by State Fund as the first three days of medically substantiated disability. These days of disability do not need to be full days, consecutive days, or days that the employee was scheduled to work. The waiting period is calculated the same for all employees regardless of work schedules and time bases. Here are two examples:Emily Employee was injured on Thursday. The doctor reported, and State Fund confirmed, that Emily was disabled and could not return to work until Monday. The waiting period was served (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). Emily Employee was injured on Thursday. The doctor reported, and State Fund confirmed, that Emily could only work half time Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and return to work on her regular schedule on Monday. The employee has served the waiting period (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday).",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ," Prior to July 1, 2014, how was the three calendar day waiting period and 14 day period calculated?",The waiting period did not need to be consecutive or full days of absence. Partial days of absence relating to the disability (including medical appointments) were accumulated to 24 hours to fulfill the waiting period.

Workers Comp ,"If an employee incurred a work-related injury or illness at one state agency and transfers to another agency, which agency is responsible for paying IDL?","Each agency is responsible for paying IDL during the periods of disability that occurred while the employee was working for that agency. The agency losing the employee has a duty to provide any history of IDL paid (calendar, 618S, etc.) to the agency gaining the employee.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ,Whose responsibility is it to track the waiting period and the 52 weeks or appropriate hours of IDL?,"It is the agency’s responsibility to track the waiting period and the hours of IDL. The agency should notify State Fund 30 days prior to the final hour of IDL, so that State Fund can begin paying TD, if appropriate. It is State Fund’s responsibility to notify agencies of medically substantiated periods of disability, including the waiting period. After July 1, 2014, full-time employees have 2080 hours of IDL available. To determine the eligible hours of IDL, for other time bases, use the following formula: 2080 x time base = total hours available The calculations for some common time bases are shown below:
1/2 time employees: 2080 x 1/2 = 1040 hours 3/4 time employees: 2080 x 3/4 = 1560 hours 5/6 time employees: 2080 x 5/6 = 1733 hours 4/5 time employees: 2080 x 4/5 = 1664 hours 7/8 time employees: 2080 x 7/8 = 1820 hours
",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ,How are the appropriate hours of IDL tracked for employees who change time bases during the time they are receiving IDL benefits?,"The goal is to provide 52 weeks of IDL benefits within a two year period. If an employee changes time bases during their period of IDL eligibility, you will need to recalculate the available hours to insure the employee receives the benefits they are entitled to. Convert the hours the employee used to days (may need to approximate). Subtract that number from 260 paid days in a year to determine the number of available days of IDL. Convert the number of available days back to hours at the new time base. Here are two examples: Emily Employee was a full-time employee and used 360 hours of IDL, then her time base was reduced to ¾ time. How many hours of IDL are available?  360 hours at full-time = 45 days (360 divided by 8 hours/day)
260 – 45 = 215 x 6 (3/4 time = 6 hours per day) = 1290 hours of IDL available
Emily Employee was a half time employee and used 175 hours of IDL, then her time base was increased to 7/8 time. How many hours of IDL are available?
175 hours at 1/2 time = 44 days (175 divided by 4 hours/day = 43.75 round
to 44)
260 – 44 = 216 x 7 (7/8 time = 7 hours per day) = 1512 hours of IDL available

Workers Comp ,Should employees on alternate work week schedules have their schedules changed to a 5-8-40 schedule?,No. An employee off for the month on IDL can remain on their alternate work schedule and does not earn or use excess hours or holidays. An employee cannot be paid more than the maximum hours in the pay period.,https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ,How are excess/deficit hours shown for employees on alternate work week schedules who are using IDL intermittently or working while on IDL?,Treat the employee the same as if they were working. The employee receives a credit for months when there is an excess and for months with a deficit they must use leave credits to supplement the number of hours required for the pay period.,https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ,Does the amount of leave credits used to supplement IDL count toward the hours of IDL the employee is entitled to?,"No. Leave credits used for supplementation have a dollar value, but no “time value.” The employee’s time off is already covered by IDL, the supplementation is just a cash out of available leave credits to bridge the gap between the IDL payment and regular salary.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp , Can an employee receiving IDL go on vacation?,"Yes. If the employee is totally temporarily disabled and receiving full IDL, continue the IDL payment. If the employee is working while on IDL, continue the IDL payment and post appropriate leave credits for the additional time missed from work. Agencies are encouraged to share information about the employee’s activities with the claims adjuster.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ,Are employees entitled to special pay(s) when they are on IDL?,"Refer to Section 14, “Pay Differentials”, in the California State Civil Service Pay Scales Manual to determine if the special pay should be included or excluded from the IDL calculation. If it states that the pay should be included in the calculations and is ongoing, the IDL calculation must include the special pay. If the special pay is task related (e.g., diving pay) and the employee must perform the task to receive the pay, the special pay should only be included if the employee was scheduled to perform the task.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ,Is an employee entitled to shift differential while on IDL?,"Yes, if the employee was receiving the shift differential at the time of the injury. However, if there is a regular shift rotation that would place the employee on a shift not entitled to the differential, payments for IDL and supplementation should be recalculated to exclude shift pay.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ,How is an employee compensated for holidays while receiving IDL?,"If the holiday falls within the disability period it is compensated in the employee’s IDL payment.  If the holiday falls outside the disability period or is a Saturday Holiday, provide payment or holiday credit as if the employee were not receiving IDL. If the employee is working reduced hours due to the injury, and receiving IDL for the balance of the hours, the employee would be paid for the holiday and the time would not count against the employee’s IDL benefits.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ,Can an employee who is in two state miscellaneous positions qualify for IDL in both positions?,"Yes. If both positions are CalPERS/CalSTRS-qualifying positions, the employee may receive IDL if he or she is disabled in both jobs, as long as the total IDL compensation does not exceed the equivalent of one full-time position. The position with the higher time base is used for this calculation; if both positions are equal in time base, the higher salaried position is used. If the employee is in a full-time position and a part-time position, IDL is paid on the full-time position.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ,Can an employee who is in two state safety positions qualify for EIDL in both positions?,"Yes. If both jobs qualify for EIDL, the employee is disabled from both jobs, State Fund has notified both agencies, and the appointing powers at both jobs approve the benefits.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp , Does an employee continue to make CalPERS/CalSTRS contributions and earn full retirement credit while receiving IDL?,"Yes. An employee’s full CalPERS/CalSTRS contribution will be deducted from the IDL payment. The employee will continue to earn full retirement credits. For more information regarding retirement contributions, contact CalPERS or CalSTRS directly.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ,Does an employee continue to make CalPERS/CalSTRS contributions and earn full retirement credit while receiving IDL?,"Yes, however per Government Code section 19844.1, time when an employee is excused from work because of holidays, sick leave, vacation, annual leave, compensating time off, or any other leave shall not be considered as time worked by the employee for the purpose of computing cash or compensating time off for overtime.

Once the period of disability has been confirmed by State Fund, the agency will restore those leave credits and pay IDL.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ,"If an employee is injured prior to becoming a CalPERS or CalSTRS member and becomes a member while on TD, can he or she elect to go on IDL?",No. The employee must remain on TD for the duration of the disability because they were not eligible for IDL on the date of injury.,https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ,Can an employee receive IDL after reaching maximum medical improvement or becoming permanent and stationary?,"When an employee becomes permanent and stationary, they are no longer eligible for IDL. However, in some cases, an employee will experience a subsequent period of temporary disability. This would entitle the employee to an additional period of IDL if State Fund confirms the subsequent period of temporary disability and the employee has not exhausted their IDL benefits.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ,"s it possible for an employee to receive IDL and NDI on the same date, assuming that they qualify for both benefits?","Yes. If the NDI benefit is greater than the IDL benefit that the employee is due for the day, the employee gets the IDL and the balance due for NDI. For example, if the IDL benefit is $10 and the NDI benefit is $19, the employee receives $10 in IDL benefits and $9 in NDI benefits.

Workers Comp , Can an employee attend jury duty while on IDL?,"Yes, if the work restrictions placed on the employee do not conflict with jury service. The employee is bound by the same rules regarding jury duty as if they were working, and should provide substantiation of jury service. The agency should interrupt IDL for the period of time the employee is on jury duty and place them on regular pay status. Once jury duty is completed, the employee should be placed back on IDL. The regular pay days/hours do not count toward the IDL limit.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ,Is an employee eligible for catastrophic leave while waiting for IDL to be approved or for supplementation of IDL?,Yes. An employee may be eligible for an agency’s catastrophic leave program if the nature of the illness or injury otherwise meets the criteria established by the agency for catastrophic leave.

Workers Comp ,Can an employee who is on IDL change their marital status and dependents?,"Adding or deleting family members can be done whenever appropriate. However, changes may not be made to exemptions for the purpose of tax withholding during the first 22 working days or 176 hours of approved IDL (which are paid at full net salary), because Government Code section 19871 requires that IDL payments be based on the net salary at the date of injury. Marital status and dependents may be changed after the first 22 working days or 176 hours of IDL have been paid.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ,"Can an employee on IDL who subsequently demotes during the disability period retain their salary rate, or is the salary rate adjusted to reflect the demotion?","IDL should be adjusted to reflect the salary an employee would receive if the disability had not occurred.

Workers Comp ,Is an employee who is suspended because of an adverse action while on a workers’ compensation claim entitled to IDL during the suspension?,"No. An employee who is suspended and taken off pay status while on IDL may be eligible for TD without supplementation during the period of the suspension. State Fund must be notified that the employee has been suspended so they can begin TD if appropriate. However, if possible, it is best to postpone any disciplinary action until the employee has returned to work from disability leave.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ,Does the time off on suspension count towards the 52-week limit on IDL?,"No. If State Fund confirms that the employee is still temporarily disabled, the IDL will resume without any loss in benefit levels after the suspension has ended.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ,Can the employer deny IDL benefits if they have knowledge that the injured worker is working at another job while on IDL?,"No. IDL payments cannot be withheld simply because the injured worker has another job.

Workers Comp ,Is an employee who is terminated because of an adverse action entitled to IDL after the effective date of the termination?,"No. IDL is a disability leave benefit which provides for salary continuation. It is based on the assumption that the employee is a current employee and will eventually return to work. Termination is not a temporary absence and there is no expectation the employee will return to work, so there is no legal basis to provide salary continuation benefits. However, State Fund must be promptly notified by the agency when the employee is terminated, because they may be eligible for TD benefits.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ,How are employees on IDL to be treated if they are subject to layoff based on seniority?,"Employees on IDL are subject to the same procedures as other employees during a layoff. An employee on IDL should be notified at the same time as other employees and advised of their employment options.

The agency must notify State Fund promptly when an employee with a workers’ compensation claim is laid off, so State Fund can begin TD benefits if appropriate.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/work-engagement-resources/workers-compensation/
Workers Comp ,"If IDL is retroactively rescinded, does the agency have to collect the overpayment?","Yes. Agencies are obligated to set up an accounts receivable to collect the overpayment.

Dependent Re-Verification,"Why are employees required to provide the documents again, when they were provided when the dependents were initially enrolled?","Providing a copy of the documents for the initial DRV cycle will enable a more direct process for the departmental personnel offices to re-verify the family members. Departmental personnel offices are required to keep all documents used in the DRV process in the employee OPFs without a purge date. In subsequent re-verifications, employees need not provide birth certificates for natural-born children or adoption certificates for adopted children again.

CalPERS will inform you during your birth month in writing if administratively removing your family members from health benefits. The notice will include Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) continuation of coverage information.

Dependent Re-Verification,What if departmental personnel Offices do not have a current Std. 692 (Dental Enrollment Form) in the Official Personnel File (OPF)?,"If the departmental personnel office cannot locate a current Std. 692 form in the OPF, they should check with the carrier to verify which dependents are currently enrolled or instruct the employee to print a copy of their enrolled dependents from their online profile on the carrier website. Once the continued eligibility of these dependents is re-verified through the DRV process, the departmental personnel office should have the employee complete a new Std. 692 to be maintained in the OPF moving forward.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/dependent-re-verification/

If you have qualifying group health or health and dental coverage through another source, such as your spouse, you may opt to receive cash in lieu of both your state-sponsored health and dental coverage or for your state-sponsored health coverage only. Qualifying group health coverage includes health coverage that provides minimum value as established by the federal Patient Protection Affordable Care Act (ACA) and is maintained by an employer or employee organization. All state California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) health plans currently meet the law’s minimum value standards.

The ACA establishes a minimum value standard of benefits for a health plan. For a qualifying group health plan to meet the ACA’s minimum value standards, the plan must cover at least 60 percent of the total allowed costs of benefits provided under the plan. Employees may refer to their plan’s Summary of Benefits and Coverage document to determine if their coverage meets the law’s minimum value standards.

Employees enrolled in individual coverage, such as TRICARE, Medicare, Medi-Cal, and Covered California, are not eligible to receive cash in lieu of other health coverage, even if the coverage provides minimum value.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/state-employee/general-benefits/cash-option-coben/

Why Healthier U
Since state employees spend most of their waking hours at work, the State of California wants to create a workplace that promotes and sustains a culture of health to enhance the overall well-being of the state workforce so that employees are happy, healthy, and productive.

A 2012 Urban Institute Study of CalPERS medical care expenditures in 2008 found that 22.4 percent ($362 million) was attributable to chronic diseases amenable to prevention through changes in diet and physical activity. A five percent reduction among state employees in the prevalence of preventable conditions could save the state $18 million annually.

Healthier U is about improving productivity, lowering absenteeism and reducing workers’ compensation claims. It’s about helping employees meet their wellness goals so they can lead healthy lives at work and at home.

Making Workplace Wellness Work: A Labor Management Approach
Healthier U was developed by a unique partnership between CalHR, SEIU Local 1000, State Treasurer’s Office, State Controller’s Office, CalPERS, Kaiser Permanente and Sierra Health Foundation with support from The California Endowment and The California Wellness Foundation.

Healthier U is built on a unique labor-management approach that actively solicits and incorporates employee feedback by:

engaging all levels of the organization;
establishing equal representation of labor and management on committees and workgroups;
building on employees intrinsic motivation through friendly competition and peer support;
securing executive leadership support;
actively utilizing “boosters” or wellness champions to make small changes in their individual work areas and to help support wellness efforts; and

Dependent Re-Verification,Dependent Re-Verification,"Dependent Re-Verification
Introduction
The Dependent Re-Verification (DRV) is the process of re-verifying the eligibility of spouses, domestic partners, children, stepchildren, and domestic partner children (family members) for their continued enrollment for state health, dental and premier vision benefits. Government Code section 19815.9 mandates re-verifying the eligibility of these family members. Government Code section 22959 authorizes extending this review to family members enrolled in dental benefits.  The bargaining unit contracts specify that family member eligibility for dental benefits shall be the same as that prescribed for health benefits.

The DRV began in 2018. The eligibility of family members is re-verified once every three years. The re-verification period is based on the employee’s birth month.  Government Code 19815.9 also requires the employing office to:

Verify the eligibility of all dependents prior to enrolling them in health, dental and vision benefits
Retain and maintain a record of the verifying documentation for each dependent in the employee’s official personnel file
Validate/re-verify dependent eligibility at least once every three years for most dependents
Remove unverified dependents from benefits coverage

The Dependent Re-Verification (DRV) Program,The Dependent Re-Verification (DRV) Program,"The Dependent Re-Verification (DRV) Program.
The DRV program was implemented as a cost mitigation strategy for state departments effective in 2018. In an effort to control rising health care costs, CalPERS conducted a Dependent Eligibility Verification (DEV) of its membership during fiscal year 2013-14 utilizing a vendor. The DEV required departmental personnel offices to verify the eligibility of employee dependents for continued enrollment in state-sponsored health benefits. The DEV efforts resulted in cancellations of 8,379 ineligible dependents enrolled in health and resulted in a savings of over $60 million by reducing future claims and employer contribution costs.
The success of the DEV led to the adoption of Senate Bill 98, Chapter 28, Statutes of 2015, adding Government Code (GC) Section 22843.1 to the Public Employees’ Medical & Hospital Care Act (PEMHCA). GC 22843.1 implemented a permanent DRV process for departmental personnel offices, requiring departments to verify the continued eligibility of employee dependents for state-sponsored health benefits on a triennial basis and mandated CalHR to set the standards. On July 16, 2021, Assembly Bill 138, Chapter 78, Statutes of 2021, was signed into law, and the DRV authority was removed from PEMHCA and added to CalHR GC 19815.9. Authority was given to CalHR to set the Dependent Re-verification (DRV) standards
pursuant to GC 19815.9. In addition, Title 2, Section 599.855 of the California Code of Regulations clarifies and makes specific the above-mentioned statute for application by state departments.",https://calhr.benefitsprograms.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DRV-Guide-State-Employees-CalHR-Benefits-Division-website-January-2023-Clean-Copy-12282022.pdf
